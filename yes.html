 Yes? I knew you would. In order to complete your quest you must find the location of five special herbs. They will cure Blixen and, if you read everything carefully, lead you to Santa. Good luck knights!</p>

<p>To save Blixen and get a clue to Santa's position you must enter "4GBW8" into an app. The app shares its name with the solution (in Norwegian) to the riddle: "The more you make of me, the more you leave behind. What am I?"</p>
