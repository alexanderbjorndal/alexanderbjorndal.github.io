<p>The Elder Game says: "Hello deer knights, did you play a gambit to save Santa the king or was that a blunder? This is a critical position where you can use strategy or tactics. Which will you choose? Will you sacrifice Blixen the knight for a winning position or will you risk using a quiet move to try and force checkmate? The final option is so sharp/risky that I fear your technique is not yet strong enough. It can cause captures, stalemate or even resignation. 

But I know you have already decided to try the impossible option of saving Blixen the knight and Santa the king with one desperado combination. I will leave you an open file to back out of this fork. Let me check you once more before I close the file. Will you continue? Yes? I knew you would. In order to complete your quest you must find the location of five special herbs. They will cure Blixen and lead you to Santa. Good luck knights!"

To save Blixen and get a clue to Santa's position you must enter "4GBW8" into an app. The app shares its name with the solution (in Norwegian) to the riddle: "The more you make of me, the more you leave behind. What am I?"</p>
