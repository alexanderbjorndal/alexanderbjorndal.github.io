<p>The Elder Game says: "Hello deer knights, did you play a gambit to save Santa the king or was that a blunder? This is a critical position where you can use strategy or tactics. Which will you choose? Will you sacrifice Blixen the knight for a winning position or will you risk using a quiet move to try and force checkmate? The final option is so sharp/risky that I fear your technique is not yet strong enough. It can cause captures, stalemate or even resignation. </p>

<p>But I know you have already decided to try the impossible option of saving Blixen the knight and Santa the king with one desperado combination. I will leave you an open file to back out of this fork. Let me check you once more before I close the file. Will you continue?</p>
